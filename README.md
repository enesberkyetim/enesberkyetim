## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a third‑year Computer Engineering student at Marmara University with a strong drive toward cyber‑security (especially penetration testing, red teaming, and offensive tooling). I've a strong low‑level programming background (C and x86 assembly) which I find very useful while understanding, using or generating exploits and vulnerabilities. Also, I can do automation with high‑level scripting (done many in Python using Selenium and also in Linux Bash). In addition, I educate myself on core cybersecurity areas such as computer networks and operating systems which I love learning about and creatively trying to bypass. I share most of my academic and personal work right here on GitHub.

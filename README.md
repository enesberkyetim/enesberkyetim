## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a third‑year Computer Engineering student with a strong drive toward cyber‑security, red teaming, and offensive tooling. My low‑level background (C, C++, x86 assembly) lets me reason about software at the machine‑code layer, while high‑level scripting (Python, Bash) powers my automation and data‑analysis side projects. I share most of my academic and personal work right here on GitHub.
